# InfiniteGifs

Simple app that loads random gifs from https://giphy.com/ and loads them as a user scrolls the page down.

*N.B. Gifs may stop loading due to CORS issue.*

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
